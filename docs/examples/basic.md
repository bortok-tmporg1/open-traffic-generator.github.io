# Basic OTG Configurations

## Single TCP Traffic Flow between two Test Ports

File: [`flow.otg.yaml`](flow.otg.yaml).

This single flow configuration specifies:

* Flow Name: `f1`
* Packet Schedule: 
    * `1000` packets 
    * of `512B` size 
    * to be transmitted as fixed rate of `100pps`
* Packet Template: 
    * Ethernet src `02:00:00:00:01:aa` dst `02:00:00:00:02:aa`
    * IPv4 src `192.0.2.1` dst `192.0.2.2`
    * TCP ports src `start at 1024 increment by 7` dst `7`
* Test Ports
    * Tx: `p1` with OTG location `localhost:5555`
    * Rx: `p2` with OTG location `localhost:5556`

This configuration was generated by running:

```Shell
otgen create flow --rate 100 --size 512 > flow.otg.yaml
```

## Two Traffic Flows representing bi-directional UDP traffic between two Traffic Ports

File: [`bidir-flow.otg.yaml`](bidir-flow.otg.yaml).

This bi-directional flow configuration specifies:

* Flow Names: `f1`; `f2`
* Packet Schedule: 
    * `f1: 1000`; `f2: 100` packets
    * of `f1: 512B`; `f2: 256B` size 
    * to be transmitted as fixed rate of `f1: 100pps`; `f2: 10pps`
* Packet Template: 
    * Ethernet `f1` src `02:00:00:00:01:aa` dst `02:00:00:00:02:aa`; `f2` src/dst swapped
    * IPv4 `f1` src `192.0.2.1` dst `192.0.2.2`; `f2` src/dst swapped
    * TCP ports `f1` src `start at 1024 increment by 7` dst `7`; `f2` src/dst swapped
* Test Ports
    * Tx: `f1: p1` with OTG location `localhost:5555`; `f2: p2`
    * Rx: `f1: p2` with OTG location `localhost:5556`; `f2: p1`

This configuration was generated by running:

```Shell
otgen create flow --rate 100 --size 512 --proto udp | \
otgen add flow --name f2 --count 100 --rate 10 --size 256 --proto udp --swap \
> bidir-flow.otg.yaml
```

## Single Traffic Flows representing TCP traffic between two Emulated Devices

File: [`device-flow.otg.yaml`](device-flow.otg.yaml).

This single flow configuration specifies:

* Device Names: `otg1`; `otg2`
    * Ethernet Interfaces: `otg1.eth[0]`; `otg2.eth[0]`
    * MAC Addresses: `02:00:00:00:01:aa`; `02:00:00:00:02:aa`
    * IP Addresses: `192.0.2.1`; `192.0.2.2`
    * Default Gateways: `192.0.2.2`; `192.0.2.1`
    * Subnet Netmasks: `/24`; `/24`
* Flow Name: `f1`
* Packet Schedule: 
    * `1000` packets 
    * of `512B` size 
    * to be transmitted as fixed rate of `100pps`
* Packet Template: 
    * Ethernet src `02:00:00:00:01:aa` dst `02:00:00:00:02:aa`
    * IPv4 src `192.0.2.1` dst `192.0.2.2`
    * TCP ports src `start at 1024 increment by 7` dst `7`
* Flow Tx:
    * Device Interface: `otg1.eth[0]`
    * Connected to: Test Port `p1` with OTG location `te1:5555`
* Flow Rx:
    * Device Interface: `otg2.eth[0]`
    * Connected to: Test Port `p2` with OTG location `te2:5555`

This configuration was generated by running:

```Shell
otgen create device --port p1 --location "te1:5555" | \
otgen add device --name otg2 --port p2 --location "te2:5555" \
                 --ip "192.0.2.2" --gw "192.0.2.1" | \
otgen add flow --tx otg1 --rx otg2 \
> device-flow.otg.yaml
```
