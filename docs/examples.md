# Examples

## [Basic Configurations](examples/basic.md)

Here we provide a few sample OTG configuration files. See [more information](examples/basic.md) about these configurations.

* [Single TCP Traffic Flow between two Traffic Ports](examples/flow.otg.yaml)
* [Two Traffic Flows representing bi-directional UDP traffic between two Traffic Ports](examples/bidir-flow.otg.yaml)
* [Single Traffic Flows representing TCP traffic between two Emulated Devices](examples/device-flow.otg.yaml)

## [OTG Examples](examples/otg-examples/README.md)

[Open Traffic Generator examples](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/otg-examples) repository is a great way to get started. It features typical setups with OTG-based traffic generators. See the list of available setups in [OTG Examples](examples/otg-examples/README.md) section.

## Use Cases
 
Real use cases are the basis of OTG evolution. Notable open-source projects leveraging OTG:
 
* [OpenConfig Feature Profiles](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles)
* [SONiC Testbed](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt)
* [SONiC-DASH CI Pipeline](https://github.com/Azure/DASH)
